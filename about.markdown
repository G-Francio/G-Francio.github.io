<img style="float: left; padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" src="/assets/img/me.webp" alt="Picture of Francesco" height="203" width="147"> I am a third year PhD student from the University of Trieste (IT). I work under the supervision of [Stefano Cristiani](https://wwwuser.oats.inaf.it/stefano.cristiani/) on searching bright QSOs in the Southern Hemisphere and using high-resolution spectroscopy of QSO spectra to constrain cosmological parameters. I was awarded a studentship for 1.5 years at ESO, the European Southern Observatory, where I am currently based, under the supervision of Luca Pasquini.

I did all my undergraduate studies in Trieste, where I was enrolled in a bachelor and master degree in Physics. I attended astronomy courses or curricula when possible. If interested, my full CV is available [here](/assets/doc/CV.pdf).

I enjoy outreach and, when possible, try to contribute to such activities. I have volunteered to be a guide at the [ESO Supernova](https://supernova.eso.org/), at the [Universe on Tour](https://www.wissenschaftsjahr.de/2023/universe-on-tour) and gave a public talk at a high school about black holes. In my free time I try to be outside if possible, read books or play games if I can't :)

For anything, feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:francesco.guarneri@inaf.it)!
