<img style="float: left; padding: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" src="/assets/img/me.webp" alt="Picture of Francesco" height="203" width="147"> I am a postdoc at the Hamburg Observatory, working with [Jan-Torge Schindler](https://jtschindler.github.io/) to search the highest redshift QSOs in [Euclid](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid). I also collaborate with researchers from the Observatory of Trieste to search for bright QSOs using photometric data, and to use high-resolution spectroscopy of QSO spectra to constrain cosmological parameters. 

I did all my undergraduate studies in Trieste, where I was enrolled in a bachelor and master degree in Physics. I attended astronomy courses or curricula when possible. I did my PhD was in Trieste, and I was awarded a studentship for 1.5 years at ESO, the European Southern Observatory, under the supervision of Luca Pasquini. If interested, my full CV is available [here](/assets/doc/CV.pdf).

I enjoy outreach and, when possible, try to contribute to such activities. I have volunteered to be a guide at the [ESO Supernova](https://supernova.eso.org/), at the [Universe on Tour](https://www.wissenschaftsjahr.de/2023/universe-on-tour) and gave a public talk at a high school about black holes. In my free time I try to be outside if possible, read books or play games if I can't :)
