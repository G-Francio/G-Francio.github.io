title: About Me
---

I am a third year PhD student, enrolled in the University of Trieste (IT) since 2020. I work under the supervision of [Stefano Cristiani](https://wwwuser.oats.inaf.it/stefano.cristiani/) on searching bright QSOs in the Southern Hemisphere and using high-resolution spectroscopy of QSO spectra to constrain cosmological parameters. I was awarded a studentship for 1.5 years at ESO, the European Southern Observatory, where I am currently based, under the supervision of Luca Pasquini. 

I did all my undergraduate studies in Trieste, where I was enrolled in a bachelor and master degree in Physics. I attended astronomy courses or curricula when possible. If interested, my full CV is available [here]().

I enjoy doing outreach, and when possible I try to contribute to such activities. I have volunteered to be a guide at the [ESO supernova](https://supernova.eso.org/), at the [Universe on Tour](https://www.wissenschaftsjahr.de/2023/universe-on-tour) and gave a public talk at a high school about black holes. In my free time I try to be outside if possible (I love hiking!), read books or play games if can't :)

For anything, feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:francesco.guarneri@inaf.it)!
