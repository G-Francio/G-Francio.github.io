**Games**  
I mostly play single-player/coop games, with a story I can follow along :)  

- [Mass Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect)  
    I really grew attached to the characters, fun game with a fantastic story. Highly recommended!
- [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim)  
    Bethesda will find a way to sell a new version soon, I am sure of that.
- [Elden Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring)  
    [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1H4o4FW-wA) [Warning: explicit language] perfectly conveys my feeling towards this game.
- [Transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_(video_game))  
    The music and voice acting is top notch!

**Books**  
When I was young I used to read a lot; now not much, but I am trying to get back into it!

- [His Dark Materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials)  
    My favourite book series ever - Every time I read, I think I notice some new details or understand something I missed.
- [The Book Thief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_Thief)  
    I so cried at the end.
- [The Inheritance cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inheritance_Cycle)  
    Excited about the fifth book! UPDATE: The book was great! Thoroughly enjoyed it! :D
- [A song of ice and fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire)  
    Come on, GRRM, finish the series for once!

**Movies**  
Disney movies will always be among my favourites, but I have watched every single one of the ones below at least three times, so it is fair to say I like them very much :)

- [The Emperor's New Groove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Groove)
