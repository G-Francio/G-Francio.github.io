title: Searching for bright and high redshfit QSOs
---

**A Quick Overview, but in ChatGPT "conversational tone"**: So, you've got these things called QSOs (Quasi Stellar Objects, super bright Active Galactic Nuclei), and they're like treasure troves for all sorts of studies, from checking out the cosmos to understanding how galaxies evolve. But here's the catch: to make the most of telescope time, we need these dazzlingly bright targets to focus on. The hitch was that we were short on these in the southern sky. So, a bunch of surveys kicked off to hunt down these hidden gems. And that's where QUBRICS comes in, which was a big part of my PhD journey. Fast forward almost five years, and QUBRICS has managed to pinpoint and confirm the spectra of over 2000 QSOs. Some of these QSOs are like the rock stars of brightness right now, which seriously cuts down the time needed for future experiments.
