1. **The probabilistic random forest applied to the selection of quasar candidates in the QUBRICS survey**  
    *Guarneri*, Calderone, Cristiani, Fontanot, Boutsia, Cupani, Grazian, D'Odorico  

    We test the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) for the selection of bright (i < 18), high redshift (z > 2.5) QSOs. The PRF is a modified version of the Random Forest able to take into account measurement uncertainties. We tweaked the algorithm to properly handle upper limits, and used it a photometric catalogue to produce a list of QSOs candidates, some of which were confirmed with dedicated spectroscopic campaigns. We find that the PRF is able to reliably identify QSOs in large photometric catalogues.

2. **The probabilistic random forest applied to the QUBRICS survey: improving the selection of high-redshift quasars with synthetic data**  
    *Guarneri*, Calderone, Cristiani, Porru, Fontanot, Boutsia, Cupani, Grazian, D'Odorico, Murphy, Bongiorno, Saccheo, Nicastro  

    We test whether using synthetic data can be beneficial to the selection of bright (i < 18) and high-redshift (z > 2.5) QSOs. Synthetic data are generated using a parametric spectral energy distribution. We find that:  
    - The best results are obtained when training with a mix of syntetic and spectroscopically confirmed QSOs;  
    - Training with syntetic data allows to recover extreme cases (e.g., very bright targets);  
    - Using colours instead of magnitudes produces better results;  
    - The overall completeness of the selection increases, at the expenses of a reduction in purity of the catalogue.  

    Finally, we present a catalogue of spectroscopically confirmed QSOs.

3. **Fundamental physics with ESPRESSO: A new determination of the D/H ratio towards PKS1937-101**  
    Guarneri, Pasquini, D'Odorico, Cristiani, Cupani, Di Marcantonio, GonzÃ¡lez HernÃ¡ndez, Martins, MascareÃ±o, MilakoviÄ‡, Molaro, Murphy, Nunes, Palle, Pepe, Rebolo, Santos, GÃ©nova Santos, Schmidt, Sousa, Sozzetti, Trost

    Using a high resolution, high SNR spectrum of PKS1937-101 (a bright quasar at redshift 3.787) we measure the primordial deuterium abundance. This is an important parameter to test cosmological models, as it is sensitive to the baryon-to-photon ratio and as a consequence to Î©<sub>m</sub>. We find the measurement robust with respect to systematic effects, and compare the result against a collection of similar studies from literature. Finally, we compare the result against independent probes, finding that, at this stage, there are no significant tensions in the cosmologial model with respect to the primordial D abundance.

    Using Gaia data, we search for gravitationally lensed QSOs in the framework of the QUBRICS survey. These systems are important for several cosmological investigations, but are extremely rare. We propose a simple method to find new systems, and validate the method by observing six candidates, and finding four new lensed QSO pairs. The paper is now submitted to A&A ðŸŽ‰
