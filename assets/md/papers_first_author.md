1. **The probabilistic random forest applied to the selection of quasar candidates in the QUBRICS survey**, Guarneri et al. 2021

    We test the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) for the selection of bright (i < 18), high redshift (z > 2.5) QSOs. The PRF is a modified version of the Random Forest able to take into account measurement uncertainties. We tweaked the algorithm to properly handle upper limits, and used it a photometric catalogue to produce a list of QSOs candidates, some of which where confirmed with dedicated spectroscopic campaigns. We find that the PRF is able to reliably identify QSOs in large photometric catalogues.

2. **The probabilistic random forest applied to the QUBRICS survey: improving the selection of high-redshift quasars with synthetic data**, Guarneri et al. 2022

    We test whether using synthetic data can be beneficial to the selection of bright (i < 18) and high-redshift (z > 2.5) QSOs. Synthetic data are generated using a parametric spectral energy distribution. We find that:  
    - The best results are obtained when training with a mix of syntetic and spectroscopically confirmed QSOs;  
    - Training with syntetic data allows to recover extreme cases (e.g., very bright targets);  
    - Using colours instead of magnitudes produces better results;  
    - The overall completeness of the selection increases, at the expenses of a reduction in purity of the catalogue.  

    Finally, we present a catalogue of spectroscopically confirmed QSOs.

3. **Fundamental physics with ESPRESSO: A new determination of the D/H ratio towards PKS1937-101**, Guarneri et al. (submitted to MNRAS)

    Using a high resolution, high SNR spsectrum of PKS1937-101 (a bright quasar at redshift 3.787) we measure the primordial deuterium abundance. This is an important parameter to test cosmological models, as it is sensitive to the baryon-to-photon ratio and as a consequence to Î©<sub>m<sub>.
