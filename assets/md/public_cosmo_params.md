title: Constraining the primordial deuterium abundance with high resolution spectroscopy
---

**In principle, there was not much**  
A few seconds after the big bang, the simplest elements started forming: first, hydrogen, the simple possible atom in the Universe. Then, slightly more complex elements such as helium, beryllium, and lithium. In addition to these elements, some of their isotopes were formed. An isotope is an atom that has the same number of protons as the 'normal' element, but a different number of neutrons in the nucleus. Because of this, isotopes are generally less stable and far less common than the 'normal' element. Examples of isotopes are deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen, or the so-called He4, an isotope of Helium (Fig. 1).

Given that these elements were formed when the Universe was just a few seconds old, their primordial abundance depends on the conditions of the Universe at that time. The ratio of isotopes with respect to the base element also depends on the conditions under which the Universe was a few minutes after its formation. In other words, if we are able to measure some of these abundances, we can test whether our Universe works the way we think it does. We just need to figure out which elements are the most sensitive to the conditions of the early Universe, which can be accessed with our instruments and which can give a value that is representative of the true primordial abundance. If, for example, an element is destroyed during star formation cycles and we measure it in gas that has been processed by stars, then our measurement will yield a value lower than the primordial one.

**Deuterium to the rescue**  
Looking at the list of possible elements, there is not much choice: we are left with two isotopes and four different elements. Fortunately for us, there is at least one of these that we can access with current telescopes and probe the primordial abundance of: the deuterium! This is an isotope of hydrogen, with one proton and one neutron in the nucleus. Its abundance can be measured by looking at absorption lines in the spectrum of background QSOs (Fig. 2). We can be reasonably certain that the measurement will yield the primordial value if we manage to find patches of gas where not much star formation has happened yet (to be more precise, gas whose metallicity is around or lower than 1.5 solar). Even better, deuterium is also very sensitive to at least one relevant quantity that describes our Universe: the amount of baryons with respect to the total amount of content of the Universe.

Unfortunately for us, not many systems that satisfy these conditions are known, and only around 20 measurements have been performed so far. Currently, the most precise result comes from an average of seven measurements, [presented in 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11129). During my PhD I worked towards a measurement of this quantity using a new spectrum of a QSO, collected with ESPRESSO. The paper describing the analysis is now published, and available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05586.pdf)!
